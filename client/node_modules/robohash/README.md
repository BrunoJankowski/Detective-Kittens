# robohash
A robohash generator, an API for robohash (NodeJS)

And I am not lying. It is just this easy:



First Put this Line of Code to Define this Module.
```javascript
const robohash = require('robohash')
```

Then, just use the module with 1 line.
```javascript
robohash.Robot("McSkinBot")
```
And it will respond with the robohash website searching
for "McSkinBot"

Has All of Them!
